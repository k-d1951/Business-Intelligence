- Anything reported on a per month, week, or day basis should be a line chart for tracking a quantity over time. 
- Any comparison between groups, like employees, should be a bar chart. 
- Displaying a lot of text, like the names of stocks, should be done with a table.
- A/B Testing: Pick a metric to calculate. Calculate the Sample Size. Run the experiment. Calculate the significance. 
-  closer our baseline conversion is to 50%, the smaller the sample size necessary to achieve significance.
-  As the baseline conversion increases, it becomes easier to reach significance and the sample size decreases. The less sensitive our tests, the smaller the sample size we need.
